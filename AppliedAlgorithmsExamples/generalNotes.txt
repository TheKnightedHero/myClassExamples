binary min-heap
#include <queue>
allows us to set up a priority Queue

Heapsort: A minimalist's approach
  like MERGESORT, it runs in O(n lg n)
  Unlike MERGESORT, it sorts in place
  Based off of a "heap", which has several uses
  The word "heap" in context does not refer to memory management

  A binary heap is a nearly complete binary tree
      binary tree - a tree that has AT MOST two children
      nearly complete - one or more nodes only have one child on left side
  Implemented using an array A (or vector)
  Two similar attributes
    length[A] is the size(number of slots) in A
    heap-size[A] is the number of elements in the Heapsort
    thus, heap-size[A] <= length[A]
  Simple functions to know node's parent, lchild, rchild
    parent(i) = i/2
    left(i) = 2i
    right(i) = 2i + 1
