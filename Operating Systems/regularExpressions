Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a pattern/template to be matched against a string (llama book pg. 76)

Sample use:
$ grep "include" *.cpp        #The string include is a regular expression
$ grep "ab*c" myFile.txt      #Find all the lines that contain the letter 'a' followed by 0 or more b's followed by a 'c'

while($line = <STDIN>)         # while not end of file
{
  chomp $line;
  if($line =~ /ab*c/)       # ~ means does this line match the expression
  {
    print "MATCHES";
  }
  else
  {
    print "DOES NOT MATCH";
  }
  
}
