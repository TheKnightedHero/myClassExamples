1) If FIFO page replacement is used with four page frames and eight pages,
    how many page faults will occur with the reference string 0172327103 if the four frames are initially empty?
    Now repeat this problem for LRU.

          0172327103
    A:    0000333333
    B:    -111111100
    C:    --77777777
    D:    ---2222222
          FFFFF---F-
    Queue: 7230

    A:    0172327103
    B:    -017232710
    C:    --01773271
    D:    ---0111327
    
    Answer:
          FIFO: 6 page faults
           LRU: 7 page faults

2) Consider the page sequence in Figure 3-15(b) (shown below).
    Suppose that the R bits for the pages B through A are 11011011, respectively.
    Which page will second chance remove?

    1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
    B C D E F G H A

    Answer: Page D

3) A small computer on a smart card has four page frames.
    At the first clock tick, the R bits are 0111 (page 0 is 0, the rest are 1).
    At subsequent clock ticks, the values are 1011, 1010, 1101, 0010, 1010, 1100, and 0001.
    If the aging algorithm is used with an 8-bit counter, give the values of the four counters after the last tick.
    Which page would be replaced? (The one with the smallest value)

        Counter 0: 01101110   //110      //page 1
        Counter 1: 01001001   //73       //page 2
        Counter 2: 00110111   //55       //page 3
        Counter 3: 10001011   //139      //page 4

    Answer: page 3

4) In the WSClock algorithm in the Figure 3-21(c) (shown below), the hand points to a page with R = 0.
    If t = 400, will this page be removed?  What about if t = 1000?

    Answer:
          if t = 400, yes it will be removed
          if t = 1000, no it will not be removed

5)  A computer has four page frames.
The time of loading, time of last access, and the R and M bits for each page are as shown below (the times are in clock ticks):



                  Page     Loaded       Last Ref.            R          M

                  0          126             280             1          0

                  1          230             265             0          1

                  2          140             270             0          0

                  3          110             285             1          1



        (a)    Which page will NRU replace?
                Answer: page 2

        (b)    Which page will FIFO replace?
                Answer: page 3

        (c)    Which page will LRU replace?
                Answer: page 1

        (d)    Which page will second chance replace?
                Answer: page 2

6) A computer provides each process with 65,536 bytes of address space divided into pages of 4096 bytes.
    A particular program has a text size of 32,768 bytes, a data size of 16,386 bytes, and a stack size of 15,870 bytes.
    Will this program fit in the address space? If the page size were 512 bytes, would it fit?
    Remember that a page may not contain parts of two different segments.

      Answer:
            No, this particular program will not fit into  the address space. It needs 17 4096-byte pages.
            with a 512 byte page, it will fit.

7) A machine language instruction to load a 32-bit word into a register contains the 32-bit address of the word to be loaded.
    What is the maximum number of page faults this instruction can cause?

      Answer:
              The maximum number pf page faults that could occur is 4 page faults
