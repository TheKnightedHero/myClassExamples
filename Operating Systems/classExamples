(#43) Measurements of a certain system have shown that the average process runs
for a time T before blocking on I/O.  A process switch requires a time, S,
which is effectively wasted (overhead).
For round-robin scheduling with quantum, Q,
give a formula for the CPU efficiency for each of the following:
a)      Q = âˆž

b)      Q > T

c)      S < Q < T

d)      Q = S

e)      Q nearly 0



a) T/(T + S(T/Q))
= 1

e) = nearly 0


7)(#45) Five batch jobs A through E, arrive at a computer center at almost the same time.
They have estimated running times of 10, 6, 2, 4, and 8 minutes.  Their (externally determined)
priorities are 3, 5, 2, 1, and 4, respectively, with 5 being the highest priority.
 For each of the following scheduling algorithms, determine the mean process turnaround time.
 Ignore process switching overhead.
a)      Round robin.

b)      Priority scheduling.

c)      First-come, first-served (run in order 10, 6, 2, 4, 8).

d)      Shortest job first.



For a), assume that the system is multiprogrammed, and that each job gets its fair share of the CPU.
For b) through d) assume that only one job at a time runs, until it finishes.
All jobs are completely CPU bound
