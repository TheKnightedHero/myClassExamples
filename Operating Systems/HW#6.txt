Chapter 3 part 1 HW

1) A particular swapping system eliminates holes by compaction.
    Assuming a random distribution of many holes and many data segments and a
    time to read or write a 32-bit memory word of 4 nsec, about how long does it take to compact 4 GB?
    For simplicity, assume that word 0 is a part of a hole and that the highest word in memory contains valid data.
      4/4 = 1/1
      1/1    2^34/x

    Answer: 2^34 nsec

2) Consider a swapping system in which memory consists of the following hole sizes in memory order: 10MB, 4MB, 20MB, 18MB, 7MB, 9MB, 12MB, 15MB.
    Which hole is taken for successive segment requests of                                    Hole:   1    2    3     4     5    6    7     8

    (a)    12MB

    (b)    10MB

    (c)    9MB

    for first fit? Now repeat the question for best fit, worst fit, and next fit.

    Answer: (I wrote the corresponding hole numbers to help me keep track)
       First Fit: 3, 1, 4
       Best Fit:  7, 1, 6
       Worst Fit: 3, 4, 8
       Next Fit:  3, 4, 6

3) For each of the following decimal virtual addresses, compute the virtual page number and
    offset for a 4-KB page and for an 8-KB page:
    a)20000
    b)32768
    c)60000

    Answer:
                           VPN             Offest
          a) 4KB Page:     4                3616
             8KB Page:     2                3616

          b) 4KB Page:     8                   0
             8KB Page:     4                   0

          c) 4KB Page:    14                2656
             8KB Page:     7                2656

4)Using figure 3-9 (shown below), give the physical address corresponding to each of the following virtual addresses:

            (a)    20
                8K + 20 = 8192 + 20 = 8212

            (b)    4100
                4100 + 4K = 4100 + 4096 = 8196

            (c)    0
                8K + 0 = 8K

            (d)    8191
                8191 + 4K = 8191 + 4096 = 12287

            (e)    8192
                8K + 24K = 32K

    Answer:
          a) 8212
          b) 8196
          c) 8K
          d) 12287
          e) 32K

5) A machine has a 32-bit address space and an 8-KB page size.
    The page table is entirely in hardware, with one 32-bit word per entry.
    When a page starts, the page table is copied to the hardware from memory,
    at one word every 100 nsec.  If each process runs for 100 msec (including the time to load the page table),
    what fraction of the CPU is devoted to loading the page tables?

      2^32 address space
      2^13 page size =   2^32/2^13  entries




    Answer: 13/25 (52%)
