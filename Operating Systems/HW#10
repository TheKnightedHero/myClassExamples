2. Consider a magnetic disk consisting of 16 heads and 400 cylinders.
This disk is divided into four 100-cyliner zones with the cylinders in different zones containing 160, 200, 240, and 280 sectors, respectively.
Assume that each sector contains 512 bytes, seek time between adjacent cylinders is 1 msec, and the disk rotates at 7200 revolutions per minute.
Calculate the total disk capacity.

Answer:



3. Disk requests come in to the disk driver for cylinders 10, 22, 20, 2, 40, 6, and 38, in that order.
A seek takes 6 msec per cylinder moved.  How much seek time is needed for


    (a)    First-come, first served.

    (b)    Closest cylinder next.

    (c)    Elevator algorithm (initially moving upward).

    In all cases, the arm is initially at cylinder 20.


4. The clock interrupt handler on a certain computer requires 2 msec (including process switching overhead) per clock tick.
The clock runs at 60 Hz.  What fraction of the CPU is devoted to the clock?



5. A computer uses a programmable clock in square-wave mode.
If a 500 MHz crystal is used, what should be the value of the holding register to achieve a clock resolution of

            (a) a millisecond (a clock tick once every millisecond)?

            (b) 100 microseconds?



6. The designers of a computer system expected that the mouse could be moved at a maximum rate of 20 cm/sec.
If a mickey is 0.1 mm and each mouse message is 3 bytes, what is the maximum data rate of the mouse assuming that each mickey is reported separately?





7. The primary additive colors are red, green, and blue, which means that any color can be constructed from a linear superposition of these colors.
Is it possible that someone could have a color photograph that cannot be represented using full 24-bit color?



8. Assuming that it takes 2 nsec to copy  a byte,
how much time does it take to completely rewrite the screen of an 80 character x 25 line text mode memory-mapped screen?
What about a 1024 x 768 pixel graphics screen with 24-bit color?



9. A thin-client terminal is used to display a Web page containing an animated cartoon of size 400 pixels x 160 pixels running at 10 frames/sec.
What fraction of a 100-Mbps Fast Ethernet is consumed by displaying the cartoon?
