2. Consider a magnetic disk consisting of 16 heads and 400 cylinders.
This disk is divided into four 100-cyliner zones with the cylinders in different zones containing 160, 200, 240, and 280 sectors, respectively.
Assume that each sector contains 512 bytes, seek time between adjacent cylinders is 1 msec, and the disk rotates at 7200 revolutions per minute.
Calculate the total disk capacity.

zone 1: 16 × 100 × 160 × 512 = 131072000 bytes
zone 2: 16 × 100 × 200 × 512 = 163840000 bytes
zone 3: 16 × 100 × 240 × 512 = 196608000 bytes
zone 4: 16 × 100 × 280 × 512 = 229376000 bytes

131072000 + 163840000 + 196608000 + 229376000 = 720896000

Answer: 720,896,000 bytes


3. Disk requests come in to the disk driver for cylinders 10, 22, 20, 2, 40, 6, and 38, in that order.
A seek takes 6 msec per cylinder moved.  How much seek time is needed for


    (a)    First-come, first served.

            10 + 12 + 2 + 38 + 34 + 32 = 146 * 6 = 876

          Answer: 876 msec

    (b)    Closest cylinder next.

          0 + 2 + 12 + 4 + 4 + 36 +2 = 60 * 6 = 360

          Answer: 360 msec

    (c)    Elevator algorithm (initially moving upward).

          0 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 30 + 4 + 4 = 58 * 6 =

          Answer: 348 msec

    In all cases, the arm is initially at cylinder 20.


4. The clock interrupt handler on a certain computer requires 2 msec (including process switching overhead) per clock tick.
The clock runs at 60 Hz.  What fraction of the CPU is devoted to the clock?

60 * 2 = 120 / 100

Answer: 12%

5. A computer uses a programmable clock in square-wave mode.
If a 500 MHz crystal is used, what should be the value of the holding register to achieve a clock resolution of

            (a) a millisecond (a clock tick once every millisecond)?

            answer: 500,000

            (b) 100 microseconds?

            answer: 50,000



6. The designers of a computer system expected that the mouse could be moved at a maximum rate of 20 cm/sec.
If a mickey is 0.1 mm and each mouse message is 3 bytes, what is the maximum data rate of the mouse assuming that each mickey is reported separately?

20 * 10 = 200mm = 2000 mickey
2000 * 3 = 6000

Answer: 6000 bytes/sec


7. The primary additive colors are red, green, and blue, which means that any color can be constructed from a linear superposition of these colors.
Is it possible that someone could have a color photograph that cannot be represented using full 24-bit color?

Answer: Yes it is possible, that there could be a photograph that cannot be represented

8. Assuming that it takes 2 nsec to copy a byte,
how much time does it take to completely rewrite the screen of an 80 character x 25 line text mode memory-mapped screen?
What about a 1024 x 768 pixel graphics screen with 24-bit color?

2 * 80 * 25 = 4000 bytes
4000 * 2 nsec = 8,000

(3 is now used because it is a pixel graphics screen)
1024 * 768 * 3 = 2,359,296 bytes
2,359,296 * 2 = 4,718,538

Answer:
for 80 X 25: 8000 nsec
for 1024 X 768: 4,718,538 nsec

9. A thin-client terminal is used to display a Web page containing an animated cartoon of size 400 pixels x 160 pixels running at 10 frames/sec.
What fraction of a 100-Mbps Fast Ethernet is consumed by displaying the cartoon?

400 × 160 × 3 = 192,000 bytes  * 10 = 1,920,000 bytes/sec = 15,360,000 bits/sec

Answer: about 15%
