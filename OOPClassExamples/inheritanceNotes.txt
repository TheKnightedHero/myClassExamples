Can have multilevel inheritance
DSPL = Domain Specific Programming Language - a language a programmer creates for a project


polygon - any number of points and connect dots


In inheritance, functions can be overridden (overwrite)

we have a base class and a derived class

base - derived
parent - child
super - sub


The base class is what we started with  - parent class
the derived class is what we expand with - child class
