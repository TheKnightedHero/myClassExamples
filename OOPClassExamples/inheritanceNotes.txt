Can have multilevel inheritance
DSPL = Domain Specific Programming Language - a language a programmer creates for a project


polygon - any number of points and connect dots


In inheritance, functions can be overridden (overwrite)

we have a base class and a derived class

base - derived
parent - child
super - sub


The base class is what we started with  - parent class
the derived class is what we expand with - child class

chosen at run-time not compile time.
The run time choice is called late binding, also known as dynamic binding
function is called based on object type

Early binding also known as static binding is the traditional way
function is called based on pointer/reference type


virtual - function is going to use late binding
this behavior on when binding happens is referred to polymorphism
