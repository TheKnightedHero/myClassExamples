Dependency Injection && Version of Control

Dependency Injection
    -

Version of Control
    - The framework of the software already exists, so instead of downloading the library, 
        you download the structure for which you have to write code to play well with it

Ninject
    - C# ninja injection framework




SOLID Design Principles
    -SRP
        Single Responsibility Principle
            -A class should have one, and only one, reason to change
    -OCP
        Open/Closed Principle  
            -A class/module should be open for extension, but closed from modification
            -We want our classes and interfaces to stay as stable as possible
    -LSP
        Liskov Substitution Principle
            -derived classes must be usable form the base class interface, without the need for the user to know the different
            -when you are creating data types to represent something, avoid trying to represent everything in the real world
    -ISP
        Interface Segregation Principle
            -Don't depend on what you don't user
            -Make interfaces as small and as concise as possible
            -interfaces should belong to clients not the libraries
    -DIP
        Dependency Inversion Principle
            -High level modulesshould not depend on low level modules
            -Both should depend on abstractions
            -Abstractions should not depend on details
            -Details should depend on abstractions

Symptoms of bad code
    Rigidity
        -when you change something in one place, and things break in other parts of code you couldn't foresee
    Fragility
        -parts of the code that have no relationship to what you change, breaks.
    NonReusability
        -Code is coupled to other parts of code
        -Dependency
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
