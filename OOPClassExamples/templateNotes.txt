//Template notes -lecture on 10/8/18

template functions

Example that will cover "all" cases
we make a function template

template<typename T>    (if you have two types it is written teypename T, typename T2, int x)  etc.

now instead of using double as the example, we use T

The compiler uses templates to make functions


typename could be replaced with class (ints and doubles would still work with it, if this wqqas the case)

Before function name, we always put the classname, in this case a classname<T>   - classname of type T
