//Template notes -lecture on 10/8/18

template functions

Example that will cover "all" cases
we make a function template

template<typename T>    (if you have two types it is written teypename T, typename T2, int x)  etc.

now instead of using double as the example, we use T

The compiler uses templates to make functions
