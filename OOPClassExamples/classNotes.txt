What is an object?



in C#, data type called form. When you create a windows form application, it creates an object of the type.
There is a data type called form, and in the project there is a created data type called form 1 that inherits from the form.

partial means it was defined from two different "classes"


what you see is what you get - Wysiwyg = "wizzywig"
  They are not very good at dynamic sizing
