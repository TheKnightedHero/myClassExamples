What is an object?



in C#, data type called form. When you create a windows form application, it creates an object of the type.
There is a data type called form, and in the project there is a created data type called form 1 that inherits from the form.

partial means it was defined from two different "classes"


what you see is what you get - Wysiwyg = "wizzywig"
  They are not very good at dynamic sizing

all functions(function names) are addresses

  virtual function table:
  With polymorphism, given a shape pointer to a circle, when draw is called,
  the circle's draw method is called, rather than the shape's draw method.

Classes with one or more pure virtual methods are called Abstract classes
virtual void sleep() = 0; is an example of a pure virtual method


all classes that have one or more virtual methods have a v-table
Specifically called a virtual function table


Animal will only have 1 v table for itself
Lion will have its own V-table as well, despite inheriting from Animal

If we did not override the eat class in Lion, then the eat method will point
to the same location in memory as the Animal class' eat method

Polymorphism adds overhead at runtime

DO NOT USE EXCEPTION HANDLING FOR FLOW CONTROL

syntax for exception handling:
keywords:
try - try block. you try to execute code
catch - catches the exception
throw -
  -in C++ you can throw anything. in Java you can only throw type exception or those that inherit from type exception
  -C++also has an exception classes
  -abort() gets called if you throw an exception and dont handle the exception

wrap exception is try block
then you catch it

try
{
throw exception("")
}
catch(exception e)
{
}
