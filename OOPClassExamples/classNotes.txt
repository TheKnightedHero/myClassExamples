What is an object?



in C#, data type called form. When you create a windows form application, it creates an object of the type.
There is a data type called form, and in the project there is a created data type called form 1 that inherits from the form.

partial means it was defined from two different "classes"


what you see is what you get - Wysiwyg = "wizzywig"
  They are not very good at dynamic sizing

all functions(function names) are addresses

  virtual function table:
  With polymorphism, given a shape pointer to a circle, when draw is called,
  the circle's draw method is called, rather than the shape's draw method.

Classes with one or more pure virtual methods are called Abstract classes
virtual void sleep() = 0; is an example of a pure virtual method


all classes that have one or more virtual methods have a v-table
Specifically called a virtual function table


Animal will only have 1 v table for itself
Lion will have its own V-table as well, despite inheriting from Animal

If we did not override the eat class in Lion, then the eat method will point
to the same location in memory as the Animal class' eat method

Polymorphism adds overhead at runtime

DO NOT USE EXCEPTION HANDLING FOR FLOW CONTROL

syntax for exception handling:
keywords:
try - try block. you try to execute code
catch - catches the exception
  -you can have as many catch blocks as you want, only one will catch the error
  -catch(...) means catch anything that wasnt caught
throw -
  -in C++ you can throw anything. in Java you can only throw type exception or those that inherit from type exception
  -C++also has an exception classes
  -abort() gets called if you throw an exception and dont handle the exception

wrap exception is try block
then you catch it

try
{
throw exception("")
}
catch(exception e)
{
}

when you throw an exception, local variables defined will be destroyed (destructor will be called)
dynamic memory allocated will NOT be deleted

Watch lecture - was late
Only public inheritance is allowed in C# and in Java

difference between this pointer in C# vs C++
    C# this is a reference to the object

Procedural programming
  start at main follow all the code through main, and then ends
Event driven programming
    waits for user to interact with program
    outside entity interacting with your program is the Event


10/24/18 - C#
access specifiers are used per declaration in a class
Example:
    Dog d is a reference to a Dog

if you do not explicitly inherit from a class, then you implicitly inherit from a class called object
Everything inherits from object at some point
All classes are reference types
in C# the difference between classes and structs:
    Structs - value types
    Classes - are reference types
A property provides getters and setters for data members
    The getter is when its an rValue
    the setter is when it is an lValue

C# does NOT provide a copy constructor
    copying is not a normal concept in C#
Don't rely on the finalizer
Automatic garbage collection
There is no key word virtual in Java/C#  - it is always dynamic/polymorphic

Mutable/immutable objects

Mutable objects - objects that can change
immutable objects - objects that can not change

Java strings are immutable
C++ strings are mutable
